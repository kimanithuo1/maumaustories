            <p className="text-[#385471] font-teresa mb-4">
              The Mau Mau Uprising, also known as the Mau Mau Rebellion, was a significant armed conflict in British Kenya
              between 1952 and 1960. It was a key event in Kenya's path to independence and has left a lasting impact on
              the nation's history and culture.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[#385471] font-teresa mb-4">
              The conflict primarily involved the Kikuyu people, Kenya's largest ethnic group, who had been dispossessed
              of their lands by British colonial authorities. The Mau Mau fighters sought to reclaim their land and gain
              independence from British rule.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[#385471] font-teresa mb-4">
              While the uprising was militarily defeated, it set in motion a series of events that would ultimately lead
              to Kenya's independence in 1963. The stories of bravery, sacrifice, and resilience from this period continue
              to inspire and shape Kenya's national identity.
